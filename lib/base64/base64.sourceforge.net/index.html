                <h3><font color="#001F3F">Introduction</font></h3>
                <p><font color="#001F3F">This little utility implements the Base64
                Content-Transfer-Encoding standard described in RFC1113
                (http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1113.html). This is the coding scheme used by MIME to allow
                binary data to be transferred by SMTP mail. </font></p>
                <p><font color="#001F3F">I was attempting to look at a mime attachment in a badly formed
                e-mail one day.&nbsp; I was not able to find source that was simple to compile correctly
                and would actually work.&nbsp; I have been working on a project where code similar to this
                is in use. I decided that I would create a file similar to what I was looking for and make
                it available to others.&nbsp; </font></p>
                <h3><font color="#001F3F">Hosting on SourceForge</font></h3>
                <p><font color="#001F3F">Hosting on SourceForge gives me a chance to work with their
                system and with luck will allow the source to take on a life of its own.&nbsp; I will also
                host the source on one of my sites just in case.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
                <h3><font color="#001F3F">Design Goals</font></h3>
                <strong><p><font color="#001F3F">Specifically:</strong><br>
                This code is a stand-alone utility to perform base64 encoding/decoding. It should be
                genuinely useful when the need arises and it meets a need that is likely to occur for some
                users. Code acts as sample code to show the author's design and coding style. </font></p>
                <strong><p><font color="#001F3F">Generally: </strong><br>
                This program is designed to survive: Everything you need is in a single source file. It
                compiles cleanly using a vanilla ANSI C compiler. It does its job correctly with a minimum
                of fuss. The code is not overly clever, not overly simplistic and not overly verbose.
                Access is 'cut and paste' from a web page. Terms of use are reasonable.&nbsp; </font></p>
                <h3><font color="#001F3F">Hidden Agenda</font></h3>
                <p><font color="#001F3F">I am hoping that this little source file will have all its bugs
                isolated and corrected in a single round of testing so that this beta code version
                0.00.00B can actually be released as version 0.00.00R and stay there.&nbsp; Experience
                tells me this is a real long shot, but having reviewed and unit-tested the code, I think
                it's a possibility. It is, after all, a relatively simple utility. </font></p>
                <p><strong><font color="#001F3F">How you can help: </font></strong></p>
                <p><font color="#001F3F">I would be greatly obliged if you would compile the source and
                run unit test.&nbsp; Don't bother if it has already been done for your
                platforms/compilers.&nbsp; Take a look at the project and the news page to see what
                platforms have been covered.&nbsp; If you have access to a platform that has not been
                covered you can compile, run unit test and let us know the results.</font></p>
